# ScarePrank (work-in-progress)

A personal prank/demo GUI that shows glitchy Fullscreen overlays and typing effects.  
This repo is meant for **personal learning and experimentation** — contributions that improve stability, performance, or visuals are welcome, but please read the Safety & License sections below.

---

## Goals
- Make the prank visuals scarier / more polished.
- Improve performance and reliability (less CPU/RAM usage).
- Make code easier to read and reuse for learning.

---

## Important safety & usage notes (read first)
- **Do NOT run this on other people’s computers without explicit, informed consent.** This program creates Fullscreen overlays and can be intrusive — it may be considered harassment or malicious if used without permission.
- This project may access approximate IP location via third-party services. **Do not collect or transmit sensitive personal data.**
- If you share or test the program, only do so with consenting adults or on your own machine.
- If you are under 18, get permission from a parent/guardian before publishing or widely sharing code that interacts with other machines or networks.

## How you can help / contribute
- Suggest UI improvements, reduce CPU usage, or make animations smoother.
- Open issues for bugs or performance bottlenecks.
- Make PRs that keep the original copyright header intact.

**Please do not** remove the copyright/header from files or claim authorship of the original code.

## Development notes
- Kill key: `Ctrl + Shift + K` (documented in code).
- Python 3 required. Some optional features use Pillow (`pip install pillow`).
